# Book Review: Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond

## Alternative Title Suggestion

Instead of being named as "Guns, Germs and Steel", "Crops, Germs and Languages" would be a more appropriate name for the book due to its focus on languages on crops and languages more than its focus on guns and steel. In the book, the author discussed the factors that led to the distinct stage of development in civilizations and countries on the aspects of geography, lifestyle and necessities.

## Geography Determination

100,000 years ago, humans walked out of Africa and diverged into groups to different destinations. Therefore the arrival of humans was hugely distinct in the world. The arrival in the Pacific islands and the America continent were extremely late than the arrival of the Afro-Eurasia continent which created unfairness of human development—the native Americans and the people on pacific islands had less time to develop.

In addition to the distinction of human arrival, the geography of the Afro-Eurasia continent was far superior than the American continent in the aspect of domesticable crops and the axis. On the American continent, the greatest empires and civilizations had remote communication due to the mountains which led to the slow spread of culture. 

For example, a indigenous group invented wheels (would be useful for transportation) as toys which was a great invention, however, according to archaeological evidence it never appeared in the remains of neither Inca nor Aztec Empire. 

In addition to mountains, the major axis of the American Continent was North-South which was proven that the spread of people(culture exchange) would be about 50% slower than Afro-Eurasia's East-West axis. 

At last, as we would discuss in the next part, the Americas lacked domesticable crops with high calorie yield which would be necessary for a farming society being superior to a hunting-gathering society. Therefore it would be favorable for the Americans to adopt a hunting-gathering lifestyle instead of farming.

## Hunting Gathering or Farming?

Although hunting and gathering raised as the major yield for food in the early times of human history, however 10000 years ago, farming emerged on the fertile Crescent and in China and spread quickly throughout Afro-Eurasia. 

Farming could carry a much larger population than hunting-gathering because they would stay at the same place all year round and this would lead to population boom. The huge population led to the necessity of conducting a central bureaucrat office, so the chiefdoms nearby formed together into states. 

The larger the states are, the more complex the bureaucracy system is and the larger the resources they can gain. Even further, the states become centralized monarchy powers which would direct the whole state more swiftly than before. 

Moreover, the creation of states, gave the chance for large population of people to share a same identity— I am from Song Empire, I am from Roman Empire eg. The sense of nationalism would fuel states to expand and conquer other states. 

Therefore, in order to be more superior, new weapons, technologies and bureaucrats were invented for conquering and competing. The American tribes and chiefdoms would be no match against experienced and well equipped soldiers from Afro-Eurasia.

## Language: How to Unite People

Writing would have been the greatest inventions ever made in history, due to its use of documentary. Advanced societies could use writing as ways to record the experiences.

However, this technique has not developed in the Americas. It would have been a great disadvantage for them.

## Conclusion: Yali's Question

Yali's question: why are Europeans' societies far superior than our New Guineas? 

The author used the whole book to answer it: human occupation was much later and the axis were not suitable for culture exchange while they also lacked domesticable high yield crops, these disadvantages led to their hunting gathering lifestyle and therefore did not enhance societies to the level of states. This gave them no chance of fighting well equipped Europeans.
