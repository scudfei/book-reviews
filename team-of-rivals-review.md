# Book Review: Team of Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin

## Introduction

Written by Doris Goodwin, who won the Lincoln prize with this biography, illustrated the political atmosphere and chronicle on the aspect of the four rivals who were the main characters: Abraham Lincoln, a poor lawyer who came from a farm in Kentucky and embarked his political journey in Springfield, Illinois; Salmon Chase who was born in New Hampshire established his career of law in Cincinnati, Ohio and was famous on defending fugitive slaves as a radical abolitionist; Henry Seward, a native yankee senator who was backed by the New York political boss Thurlow Weed enjoyed a great reputation among the old whigs; Edward Bates, a relatively moderate republican and had a huge family. The four men competed and collaborated in the whole book and wove their relationship and friendship.

## Early Life and Education

In the early life of these four, they all suffered great losses in families, Seward, Chase and Lincoln lost their fathers at a young age and were forced to leave home to a different environment. However, similarly they all were fond of reading and accumulating knowledge, at last they all went to universities to study law.

## Political Rise in Their States

After graduating from universities, the four all participated actively in politics in their own states: Lincoln in Illinois, Seward in New York, Chase in Ohio and Bates in Missouri. 

They soon all became eminent politicians and had great success: Seward, became a federal senator in congress representing state New York; Chase became popular among radicals by lawsuit against Fugitive slave law being constitutional and then became the governor of Ohio; Edward Bates served as representative, senator and attorney general in state Missouri; Lincoln soon became a senator, although the term was blamed, he then became famous for fighting Stephen Douglas in debate about slavery and rose as a potential competitor of nomination.

## Formation of the Republican Party

After the loss to Democrats in 1856, leading by Salmon Chase and Henry Seward, the Republican party was formed to unite more powers: the Know Nothings (who were against the Irish and Germany immigration but some were also anti-slavery, Chase was hated by Know nothings due to him speaking publicly against them), old whigs (who supported restricting slavery in some states following the Missouri Compromise while encouraging tariffs and internal development), the radical whigs (who encouraged banning fugitive slave law represented by Salmon chase), some moderate democrats in the north. 

The new party achieved great success by electing senators and representatives to houses and congress.

## The Republican Nomination Contest

The time had come to the republican president nomination, the four rivals would finally compete against each other. Seward was considered to win the election with ease due to his huge support in New York and the Old Whigs. However, taking Thurlow Weed's suggestion, in the most important months before nomination, he left for Europe to have a vacation. 

Salmon Chase on the other hand prepared poorly and gave up the chance to speak at Silver Union which the chance to speech chance was in turn given to Lincoln and Lincoln used it as a great chance to increase his popularity nationally. 

In addition, Lincoln had great election assistants: John Hay and John Nicolay who visited potential supporters of Lincoln to establish the strategic goal of "being the second choice in other candidates' states". 

The moderate approach toward nomination provided Lincoln a great advantage compared to three others: Seward, had conflicts with Pennslvinia Cameron and Steerly; Edward bates supported by Know Nothings in Missouri was opposed by German Immigrants who also made up a great part in the party; Chase, still struggled in the hatred of Know Nothings. 

Therefore after Bates and Chase were eliminated in the first round, most of their votes shifted to Lincoln and led to his victory for nomination. In the 1860 election, Lincoln succeeded in winning border states and all northern states and at last won the election.

## Lincoln's Cabinet and the Civil War

After the election, Lincoln suffered in forming his cabinet to balance the powers, all three rivals were invited to join the cabinet while Cameron from Pennsylvania as well as some border state democrats. However, several southern states seceded from the union and formed the confederacy and the Civil War began.

Behind the presidency of Lincoln, conflicts in the cabinet had been unsettled with Seward against Chase and Cameron while Chase hated Cameron. The conflict resulted in Cameron and Chase's resignation with Stanton replacing them. 

After replacing General Mclean with General Ulysess Grant who succeeded in cutting the Mississippi river supply lines of the confederates on Independence day. Then in 1865, Richmond fell and General Robert Lee resigned.

## Conclusion: Lincoln's Leadership

In the whole book, the Author succeeded in characterizing Lincoln as a patient and inclusive leader who always holds the moderate solution to problems. He succeeded in keeping forces balanced. This was what we called the true leadership, to evaluate to mediate and to find the best for all people.
